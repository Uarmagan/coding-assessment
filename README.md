# HOW TO START APPLICATION

1. First run `npm install` to install all dependencies
2. Run the command `npm start` to start the application
3. Then go to `localhost:3000/docs` to open the swagger page
   Swagger is a documentation tool for API's used to get quick feedback and test them, but feel free to make requests from a curl command or whatever works best
